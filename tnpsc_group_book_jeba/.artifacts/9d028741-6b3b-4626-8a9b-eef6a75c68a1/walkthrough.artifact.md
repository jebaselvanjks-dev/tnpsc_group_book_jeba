# Walkthrough - Share Function and Poster Content Fix

I have fixed the share functionality and refined the generated poster to match the design provided.

## Changes Made

### 🎨 Poster Consistency & Styling
- **Fixed Font Scaling**: Updated `AppTheme.getStyle` to support an `ignoreScale` parameter. This ensures the share poster looks exactly as designed, even if the user has set a large font size in the app settings.
- **Visual Refinement**:
    - Updated the header text to "TNPSC Master: Group 1, 2, 4" and "தினமும் படி, வெற்றியை வெல்லு!".
    - Improved the circular logo display with better padding and glowing effects.
    - Verified the sidebar items (Live Quiz, Rank, etc.) and Google Play badge alignment.
    - All poster elements now use `ignoreScale: true` for a "constant" look.

### 📏 Dynamic Poster Height
- **Flexible Layout**: Refactored the poster from absolute positioning (`Stack` with `Positioned`) to a flexible flow (`Column` and `Row`).
- **Push-to-Bottom Branding**: Used `Flexible` and `Spacer` logic to ensure the branding, mockup, and battle sections stay at the bottom, while the Quiz section expands downwards if the question is long.
- **Minimum Height**: Set a `minHeight: 700` so that short questions still result in a standard-sized, balanced poster.
- **High-Quality Capture**: Updated the screenshot capture settings to automatically adjust to the poster's dynamic height while maintaining a fixed width of 400px.

### 🛠️ Share Functionality Fix
- **Corrected API Usage**: Replaced the non-functional `SharePlus.instance.share` with the correct `Share.shareXFiles` from the `share_plus` package.
- **Improved Reward Logic**: Added a check for `ShareResultStatus.success` before awarding the 50 points, ensuring users actually complete the share action.

### 📂 Files Modified
- [app_theme.dart](file:///C:/Users/ADMIN/StudioProjects/tnpsc_group_book_jeba/tnpsc_group_book/lib/utils/app_theme.dart): Added `ignoreScale` to `getStyle`.
- [profile_screen.dart](file:///C:/Users/ADMIN/StudioProjects/tnpsc_group_book_jeba/tnpsc_group_book/lib/screens/profile_screen.dart): Fixed share logic and applied fixed-scale styles to the poster.

## How to Verify
1. Go to the **Profile** screen.
2. Tap on **Share with Friends**.
3. Observe the **Share Preview** dialog; the poster should match your design and not be affected by app font settings.
4. Tap **Share Now** and complete the sharing process.
5. Verify you receive the 50 points reward after a successful share.
